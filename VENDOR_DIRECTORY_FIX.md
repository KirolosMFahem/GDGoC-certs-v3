# Vendor Directory Permission Fix

## Problem Statement

When running the application with Docker Compose, users encountered the following error:

```
/var/www/html/vendor does not exist and could not be created

In Filesystem.php line 261:
  /var/www/html/vendor does not exist and could not be created
```

This error occurred during the container startup when the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script attempted to run `composer install`.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a permission conflict between the Docker image and the volume mounts in docker-compose.yml:

1. **Docker Image Build**: 
   - The Dockerfile builds PHP dependencies using `composer install` 
   - Dependencies are installed in `/var/www/html/vendor` as the root user during build
   - Then the image switches to a non-root user (`appuser` with UID 1000)

2. **Volume Mount Conflict**:
   - `docker-compose.yml` mounted the entire host directory: `.:/var/www/html`
   - This mount **overwrites** the `/var/www/html/vendor` directory from the Docker image
   - The mounted directory is owned by the host user, not `appuser`

3. **Permission Denied**:
   - When the entrypoint script runs as `appuser` and tries to create `/var/www/html/vendor`
   - It fails because `appuser` doesn't have write permissions to the mounted host directory

## Solution

The fix uses Docker **named volumes** to preserve the vendor and node_modules directories:

### Changes to docker-compose.yml

Added named volumes for `vendor` and `node_modules` to all PHP-based services:

```yaml
services:
  php:
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html
      - ./storage:/var/www/html/storage
      - vendor:/var/www/html/vendor          # Named volume
      - node_modules:/var/www/html/node_modules  # Named volume

volumes:
  vendor:
    driver: local
  node_modules:
    driver: local
```

This was applied to three services:
- `php` (main PHP-FPM service)
- `queue-worker` (background job processor)
- `scheduler` (scheduled task runner)

### Changes to Dockerfile

Updated the permissions to ensure `appuser` owns the vendor directory:

```dockerfile
# Set permissions
RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /var/www/html/storage /var/www/html/bootstrap/cache /var/www/html/vendor
```

### Changes to Redis Installation

Updated PECL Redis installation to handle network issues better:

```dockerfile
# Install Redis extension
RUN pecl channel-update pecl.php.net && \
    pecl install redis && \
    docker-php-ext-enable redis
```

## How It Works

1. **Named volumes override host mounts**: When both a host mount and a named volume target the same path, the named volume takes precedence for that specific subdirectory.

2. **Preservation of built artifacts**: The vendor directory built during the Docker image creation is copied to the named volume and preserved.

3. **Proper permissions**: The vendor directory is owned by `appuser`, so the entrypoint script can successfully run composer commands.

4. **Persistent dependencies**: Dependencies persist across container restarts without being overwritten by the host mount.

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No permission errors**: The `appuser` can read and write to the vendor directory
2. ✅ **Faster startup**: Dependencies from the Docker image are reused
3. ✅ **Consistent behavior**: Works the same in development and production
4. ✅ **Reduced disk usage**: Dependencies aren't duplicated on the host filesystem
5. ✅ **Security**: Maintains non-root user security best practices

## Testing the Fix

To test the fix after applying these changes:

```bash
# Clean up any existing volumes
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild the image (if network issues with PECL, see Troubleshooting)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check that services started successfully
docker compose ps

# Verify vendor directory exists and has correct permissions
docker compose exec php ls -la /var/www/html/vendor

# Check logs for any errors
docker compose logs php
```

## Troubleshooting

### PECL Network Issues

If you encounter DNS resolution errors when building the image:

```
Cannot retrieve channel.xml for channel "pecl.php.net"
```

This is a temporary network restriction. The Redis extension is optional for basic functionality. You can:

1. Wait and retry the build later when network access is available
2. Use a different network connection
3. For testing only, temporarily comment out the Redis extension installation

### Resetting Volumes

If you need to completely reset the vendor directory:

```bash
# WARNING: This removes ALL volumes including database data
docker compose down -v

# Rebuild and restart
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Checking Volume Contents

To inspect what's in the vendor volume:

```bash
docker compose exec php ls -la /var/www/html/vendor
docker volume inspect gdgoc-certs-v3_vendor
```

## Migration Guide

For existing deployments, follow these steps:

1. **Backup your data** (especially database volumes)
2. Pull the latest changes with this fix
3. Stop the containers: `docker compose down`
4. **Optional but recommended**: Remove vendor volume: `docker volume rm gdgoc-certs-v3_vendor`
5. Rebuild the image: `docker compose build --no-cache`
6. Start the services: `docker compose up -d`
7. Verify everything works: `docker compose ps` and `docker compose logs`

## Summary

This fix resolves the vendor directory permission issue by using Docker named volumes to preserve built dependencies and maintain proper ownership. The solution is minimal, follows Docker best practices, and improves both security and performance.
